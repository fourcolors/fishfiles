# Sterling's fish files

This is a fork of rstacruz/fishfiles with my personal touches


Requires fish 2.6+.

```bash
brew install fish --HEAD
```

Clone:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/fourcolors/fishfiles.git ~/.config/fish
```

In a new shell:

```bash
# Install dependencies
fisher

# Load abbreviations
source ~/.config/fish/abbreviations/all.fish
```
